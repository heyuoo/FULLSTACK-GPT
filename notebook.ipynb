      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",

      "- 4 eggs\n",
      "- Sesame oil\n",
      "- Soy sauce\n",
      "- Gochujang (Korean red chili paste)\n",
      "- Sesame seeds\n",
      "- Salt\n",
      "- Vegetable oil\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Marinate the beef: In a bowl, mix the beef slices with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, and a pinch of black pepper. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Prepare the vegetables:\n",

      "- Zucchini: Repeat the same process for the julienned zucchini.\n",
      "- Spinach: Blanch the spinach in boiling water for 1 minute, then rinse with cold water and squeeze out excess water. Season with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of sesame oil.\n",
      "- Bean sprouts: Blanch the bean sprouts in boiling water for 2 minutes, then rinse with cold water and squeeze out excess water. Season with salt and sesame oil.\n",
      "- Shiitake mushrooms: Heat a pan with vegetable oil and saut√© the sliced mushrooms until cooked. Season with soy sauce and sesame oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cook the beef: In the same pan used for the mushrooms, cook the marinated beef slices until browned and cooked through. Set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fry the eggs: In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up or over easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Assemble the Bibimbap:\n",
      "- Divide the cooked rice into serving bowls.\n",
      "- Arrange the cooked vegetables and beef on top of the rice.\n",
      "- Place a fried egg on the center of each bowl.\n",
      "- Serve with a side of gochujang and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Mix everything together before eating to enjoy the flavors of all the ingredients combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade Bibimbap! Feel free to customize the toppings based on your preferences.For a vegetarian version of Bibimbap, you can make a few simple swaps to replace the beef in the traditional recipe. Here's how you can adapt the recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative Ingredients:\n",
      "- Instead of beef, you can use tofu as a protein-rich substitute. Extra-firm tofu works well for this dish.\n",
      "- You can also consider using tempeh as another plant-based alternative to beef. Tempeh has a nutty flavor and a firm texture that can complement the other ingredients in Bibimbap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation:\n",
      "1. Marinate the tofu or tempeh: Cut the tofu or tempeh into thin slices or cubes. Marinate them in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and a pinch of black pepper for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cook the tofu or tempeh: In a pan, heat some vegetable oil and cook the marinated tofu or tempeh until browned and slightly crispy on the outside. Set aside once cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Follow the rest of the recipe as instructed, preparing the vegetables and eggs, and assembling the Bibimbap bowls.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. When assembling the Bibimbap, place the cooked tofu or tempeh on top of the rice along with the vegetables and fried egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Serve with a side of gochujang and sprinkle with sesame seeds before mixing everything together and enjoying your vegetarian Bibimbap.\n",
      "\n",
      "By making these simple ingredient swaps, you can create a delicious and satisfying vegetarian version of Bibimbap that retains the essence of the traditional dish while catering to a plant-based diet."
